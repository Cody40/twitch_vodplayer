# Codyplayer
A github pages project I made to make twitch VOD viewing easier on mobile

Made for personal use so everything is kinda 'works for me'

Makes it easier to
- move to timestamps
- pause and start
- go forward/backward by 5 seconds
- set the quality of the video(up to 1080p60, will not work if source VOD doesn't offer high qualities)
+ Also starts with 100% twitch volume instead of 50%
